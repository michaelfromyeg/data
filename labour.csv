Footnotes:
1,"The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is an industry classification system developed by the statistical agencies of Canada, Mexico and the United States. Created against the background of the North American Free Trade Agreement, it is designed to provide common definitions of the industrial structure of the three countries and a common statistical framework to facilitate the analysis of the three economies. NAICS is based on supply side or production oriented principles, to ensure that industrial data, classified to NAICS, is suitable for the analysis of production related issues such as industrial performance. Since 1997, the System of National Accounts' (SNA) input-output industry classification system is based on NAICS. In the National Accounts industries, the levels of the different classification systems were chosen so as to provide the most detail possible in order to maximise continuity with the previous classification systems used in Statistics Canada since 1961. Therefore, the greatest level of detail that is available over time occurs at the L level of aggregation, which corresponds, to 105 industries. This L level can also be aggregated to the M level (medium - 56 industries) and to the S level (small - 21 industries)."
2,"Quarterly estimates of productivity in the total economy and in the industries are derived from a Fisher chained index of gross domestic product (GDP). The approach to measure the GDP in the total economy differs from the one that used in the estimates by industry. For the total economy, GDP is measured using the expenditure approach at market prices published by the Quarterly Income and Expenditure Accounts. For the estimates by industry, GDP is measured using the value added approach at basic prices published by the Industry Accounts Division. This was the Fisher chained index in the case of years for which final input-output tables are available. For the most current years or annual post-benchmarks, the real GDP is based on a fixed-weight Laspeyres chained index formula. GDP estimates in the productivity measures for the businesses producing services and for real estate, and rental and leasing exclude the rental value of owner occupied dwellings."
3,"The estimate of the total number of jobs covers four main categories: employee jobs, work owner of an unincorporated business, own account self-employment, and unpaid family jobs. The last category is found mainly in sectors where family firms are important (agriculture and retail trade, in particular). Jobs data are consistent with the System of National Accounts."
4,This is the quarterly average of hours worked for jobs in all categories.
5,"The number of hours worked in all jobs is the quarterly average for all jobs times the annual average hours worked in all jobs. Hours worked data are consistent with the System of National Accounts. According to the retained definition, hours worked means the total number of hours that a person spends working, whether paid or not. In general, this includes regular and overtime hours, breaks, travel time, training in the workplace and time lost in brief work stoppages where workers remain at their posts. On the other hand, time lost due to strikes, lockouts, annual vacation, public holidays, sick leave, maternity leave or leave for personal needs are not included in total hours worked."
6,"Labour productivity is the ratio between real GDP and hours worked. For the estimates of productivity in the total economy, a Fisher chain index of GDP at market prices is used as measure of the output. On the other hand, in the quarterly productivity estimates for the industries, a Fisher chain index of GDP at basic prices for each industry is used as measure of the output up to the last year benchmark for which final input-output tables are available, after that by a fixed-weight volume Laspeyres chained index formula for the most recent years."
7,"The ratio between total compensation for all jobs, and the number of hours worked. The term ""hourly compensation"" is often used to refer to the total compensation per hour worked."
8,"This measures the cost of labour input required to produce one unit of output, and equals labour compensation in current dollars divided by the real output. It is often calculated as the ratio of labour compensation per hour worked and labour productivity. Unit labour cost increases when labour compensation per hour worked increases more rapidly than labour productivity. It is widely used to measure inflation pressures arising from wage growth. The measure of real value added used in the labour unit cost estimation is based on a Fisher chain index excluding the rental value of owner occupied dwellings."
9,Unit labour cost in United States dollars is the equivalent of the ratio of Canadian unit labour cost to the exchange rate. This latter corresponds to the United States dollar value expressed in Canadian dollars.
10,Total economic activities that have been realized within the country. That covers both business and non-business sectors.
11,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 11, 21, 22, 23, 31-33."
12,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 41, 44-45, 48-49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 61, 62, 71, 72, 81. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) used to measure productivity excludes rent value for owner occupied dwellings from the business service producing industries."
13,This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 52 and 55.
